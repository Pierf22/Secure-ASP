            <h2 class="mb-3">Step 1: Install Required Libraries</h2>
            <p>Before generating keys, ensure you have the required libraries installed. For this tutorial, we’ll be using Python with the cryptography package. You can install it by running the following command:</p>
            <pre class="code p-3 rounded"><code>pip install cryptography</code></pre>

            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Step 2: Generate and Save Your Key Pair</h2>
            <p>With the cryptography library installed, you can generate and save an RSA key pair using the following Python script. This script will generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair and save both the private and public keys in PEM format.</p>

                                A private key is essential for generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which you submit to a certificate authority to receive a server certificate. This certificate, along with your private key, is required to sign files securely, verifying their authenticity and protecting their integrity. Keeping your private key secure ensures that only you can sign files with your certificate.

                                Creating your own cryptographic keys is a more secure approach because it ensures that only you have access to the private key. When a server generates your keys, there’s a risk that the server or anyone with access to it could potentially intercept or misuse your private key. By generating your keys locally, you keep control over your private key and reduce the risk of unauthorized access. This method also strengthens the overall security of your encrypted data, ensuring that only you can decrypt and access sensitive information.

                            If you lose your private key, you may permanently lose access to any data encrypted with it, as no one can recreate the original key. To prevent data loss, it’s essential to securely back up your private key in a safe location that only you can access. If your key is associated with a digital certificate, you may need to generate a new key pair and request a new certificate from the server.
